## Idea

I’ve an interesting project that’s a bit data related but not only. In my living room, I’ve a sort of opening in the wall between the door and kitchen countertop where I’d like put some shelves for my books. While having a dinner with a friend over wine, we were doing some random sketches then we came up with the idea of series of shelves made of tetris like blocks. 

## Requirements

I’ve of course certain expectations:
- Bookcase should be firm enough so that I don’t find all my books on the floor with the tetris pieces at 4am on a random day.  
- It should be modular. There are more than one aspect to this of which the first one is a must:
  - I should be able to arrange tetris pieces I’ve in a way I want. 
  - The base material for each piece should be reusable for all. So that If I want, I should be able to build different tetris pieces. For instance, I can convert my `T` shape into `L` after some time. 
- Pieces should be attached to each other once placed in order to keep things stable. 


Above is the main idea that I’ve. Then I started asking myself. Then I would I arrange the tetris blocks If I have all of them. Should I leave some empty spaces between pieces ? Should I use more straight blocks or more T blocks ? What size should be blocks if I’ve a wall of 1 meter (length) to 2.5 meter (height) ? What about a 3 meter by 1 meter, is it the same size ? What If I want to build my shelves under a staircase (sort of triangle opening for future shelves), can I have something nice ? 

## Where is the data part ? Or at least coding or so ? 

In order to visualize all these, I’d like to write a small program which for a given dimensions arranges random tetris pieces in arbitrary way. Again based on the dimension, it would be nice to have some guideline/documentation for custom building tetris pieces for any one. I wonder if a project like this can go to kickstarter and be interesting for others too
